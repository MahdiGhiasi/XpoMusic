# Xpo Music Preview

Xpo Music v3 is currently in development. It utilizes [WinUI 3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) and brings numerous improvements, notably a new rendering engine (Edge Chromium) which will result in a lot of performance and reliability improvements.


### When will this get released?

Xpo Music v3.0 will replace the current version when WinUI 3 is stable enough. Currently WinUI 3 itself is in preview, and is not stable enough for production usage. The goal is to make Xpo Music v3 ready before WinUI 3 launch.

### How can I get Xpo Music 3 Preview?

Here are the steps to get the Xpo Music Preview:

1. Make sure you have installed new Edge browser (Beta, Dev or Canary version) on your PC.

2. Install test certificate [from here](https://xpomusic.com/vNext/get/XpoMusic_3.0.1.0_Debug_Test/XpoMusic_3.0.1.0_x86_Debug.cer); make sure to install it on Local Machine, inside Trusted Root Certificate Authorities.

3. Get the app by clicking on "Get the app" button on [this page](https://xpomusic.com/vNext/get/).

### Is the preview stable enough for daily use?

The core playback functionality is working and is already more performant than v2, but some crashes are to be expected.

Also, certain Windows integration features like Live Tiles and Pin To Start are not yet available in v3 Preview.

### How can I send feedback for the preview version?

Simply open an issue in this repository, make sure to mention you're talking about the preview version, and not the release version.
